# ML-project
Missing data is common problem faced by researchers and data scientists. Therefore, it is 
required to handle them appropriately in order to get better and accurate results of data 
analysis and to perform Machine Learning Algorithms.
The main objective of our Project is to fill the missing data while comparing the errors and 
results and finally get the optimal Imputation Technique.
